This project is part of the Advanced CSS and Sass course: https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sas

The main focus of this specific project is to improve my CSS skills, therefore, minimum usage of JS was used (Only for Navbar functionality).

Everything that was done on the page is done via using Sass.
